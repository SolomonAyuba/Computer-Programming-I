        Defining a Class
        A class is a template for creating objects with shared attributes and behaviours. Attributes are also known as
        fields or properties.
        Behaviours are implemented as methods.
        Example -

        CONSTRUCTORS:

        In Java, a constructor is a special type of method that is used to initialize objects when they are
        created from a class. Itâ€™s responsible for setting up the initial state of the object by assigning values
         to its instance variables and performing any necessary setup tasks.

        A class with constructors:
